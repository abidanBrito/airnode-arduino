** MOTIVATION
This repository stores the embedded software for an air quality tracking device, along with the corresponding design documents.

** BOARD INSTALLATION & HOW TO USE
Make sure that you have installed and opened Arduino IDE before following along:

1. Preferences -> Aditional URL Boards Manager -> Paste this: "https://www.adafruit.com/package_adafruit_index.json"
2. Tools -> Board -> Boards Manager. Look for "nRF52" and install the "Adafruit nRF52 by Adafruit" module.
3. Tools -> Port -> Pick the available port. 
4. Tools -> Boards -> SparkFun Pro nRF52840 Mini.
5. Load in the project within the IDE.
6. Compile & upload the code to the board.

** TESTING
Embedded applications are tricky to test via Unit Testing, but you may use apps like nRF Connect to find the generated iBeacons.
